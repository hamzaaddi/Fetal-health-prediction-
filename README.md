# Prediction-of-nitrogen-rate
This work is a compilation of all the work done under the Analytics Edge module at EMINES School Of Industiral Management. We'll be studying and using multiple aspects of Machine Learning in order to predict the values of a dependent variable based on multiple independent variables. The dataset can be found on Kaggle.

The dataset chosen revolves about fetal health classification (more coming later), this subject was chosen because of the team's interest in the medical field and how AI can predict real life outcomes.
